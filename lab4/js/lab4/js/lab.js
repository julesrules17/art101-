//Create a checkers game
	//Set up the game board
        //create an 8x8 grid
        //place black and white pieces on alternating squares
    //Define player actions
        //select a piece to move
        //choose a valid destination for the piece
        //move the piece to the destination
    //Implement game logic
        //validate player moves
        //handle capturing opponent's pieces
        //determine win or draw conditions
